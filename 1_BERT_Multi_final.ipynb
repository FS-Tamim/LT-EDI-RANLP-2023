Finding a therapist, trialling multiple therapists to see which one suits me best, or even starting on antidepressants and having to check in with a doctor/psychiatrist every few weeks, or having to change medications because one might fuck up my head even more, or not even work... all takes so much fucking effort that I can\\'t bother to do any of it.\\n\\nI went to a counsellor at my university earlier this year, and they suggested things like group therapy for my anxiety and volunteering for causes because that can give people a sense of purpose in day to day life... and I just didn\\'t know how to tell them, that is exactly the problem, *I have utterly no will to do any of that and that\\'s why I\\'m sitting in your office right now and I don\\'t know what anyone can possibly do about me being this way*.\\n\\nIf people with depression were able to so easily do things to help themselves, we wouldn\\'t need to classify it as an \\'illness\\' or \\'disorder\\'.

Thank you all for the uplifting words and thank you for the rewards! \\n\\nI鈥檇 like to first address any concerns about meeting up during the pandemic. My friend and I made plans to meet up at a coffee shop, buy a quick cup of coffee, and then immediately head to a park nearby in separate cars. The coffee shop is on small a military base so that cuts the amount of people that were in there down by a lot. I went ahead and grabbed coffee and then waited on a bench outside of the shop for around 30 minutes or so before leaving. I stayed 6 feet away from others and wore a mask the entire time. I played it safe and went by the rules.\\n\\nNext I鈥檇 like to say thank you to those who have helped me realize how big of an accomplishment it was for me to get to the coffee shop. It really did take a lot of effort and I appreciate the reminder that it took strength I didn鈥檛 know I had. \\n\\nI also want to thank those who have expressed empathy towards my friend. She is going through a rough time and has been since long before the pandemic started. I wasn鈥檛 angry at her because I understand that she鈥檚 struggling too. I was just really sad and disappointed because I鈥檝e only seen her once since last year. It was more of a bummer than anything and I just needed somewhere to get it off of my chest so I came to Reddit. Kind people of Reddit, you did not disappoint! \\n\\nI鈥檓 going to continue being her friend because she is very dear to me. Knowing the kind of person she is, she probably truly forgot, there was a potential miscommunication, or she may have had something come up that she couldn鈥檛 get out of. It would have been nice to get a bit of a heads up or an explanation, but I haven鈥檛 dwelled on it too much. She鈥檒l reach out when she鈥檚 ready to. If not, then I understand that too. \\n\\nI鈥檝e been in therapy and medication since 2018 and recently sent a cease &amp; desist letter and went no contact with my mother. As a result of that I haven鈥檛 heard from my Dad since it happened. I also live states away from my childhood friends and what鈥檚 left of the family that supports me (not many people). I鈥檓 better off being out of that toxic environment but it鈥檚 still a grief process losing people that are still alive. I have also been grieving what could have been if I only had healthy and supportive parents. \\n\\nI鈥檓 also struggling with my marriage. I鈥檓 a military spouse and it鈥檚 hard being so far away from the little support I have states away (my sisters). I won鈥檛 go into detail here about my rocky marriage but it鈥檚 been traumatic and hard. I haven鈥檛 gotten much support other than therapy and the support my younger sisters have been capable of giving. I鈥檓 in the process of filling out divorce papers and working with an attorneys office to explore my options. \\n\\nI also had surgery at the end of October to repair a hernia. It wasn鈥檛 too big of a deal, and my sisters came from out of town to visit during my recovery, but it did knock me down a bit emotionally because I was restricted from carrying anything over 20 pounds. That meant I couldn鈥檛 hold my toddler who is 30 pounds and that was really hard on both of us. \\n\\nIt just would鈥檝e been nice to be able to have hung out and talked to the one friend I have here about everything going on. It honestly would鈥檝e been nice to talk about things that have nothing to do with all of the crap that has gone on this year too. \\n\\nIt鈥檚 okay though! Life will carry on and there will be better days. I still got my coffee, got outside, then came home and hung out with my son and put up Christmas decorations. \\nI also got a ton of fantastic advise and support from you lovely folks. Thank you again!\\n\\nTL;DR Thank you for the support and kind words! I鈥檓 not mad at my friend, just sad we couldn鈥檛 meet up.

She said, instead of forcing myself to think positive, I should try to not evaluate myself at all for a certrain time. Neither negatively nor positively (though the second is rather rare anyway). What this does is that it gives some distance to the negative thoughts and therefore breaks that cycle of depression where depression makes me have negative thoughts and the negative thoughts make me depressed.\\n\\nThis is way easier because I just have to be neutral instead of positive and I notice what she means with breaking the cycle. I hope that this might help someone here.\\n\\nEdit: I don't know what to say right now...

She woke up but is unsurprisingly devastated. I want to be there as her support, she has a boyfriend but no family members who care about her and few friends. I had plans to see my family for Christmas but when this happened, it left me deeply depressed, particularly because another good friend of mine had committed suicide four years ago almost on the same day. To elaborate, I don\\'t like spending Christmas with my family. I like them, but Christmas has always been more about chores and preparations than about quiet and peace. \\n\\nI thought I would spend Christmas by visiting my friend in the hospital. I don\\'t want her to be alone, I know that if I were in her situation I would appreciate it if someone came to visit me. So I proposed this to my mother and brother, even the possibility that I would spend the afternoon with her and then go down to see them before dinner. However, their comments left gasping for air. They showed little empathy for my friend or me. My mother asked me if I had any \"normal\" friends. My brother told me that while it\\'s ultimately my choice, I would be ruining Christmas by not coming down, or even by coming down just for dinner, that everyone would be disappointed in me and it would create arguments, implying I would be at fault for them. \\n\\nHere\\'s the breakdown: with my family, I risk being ostracized for weeks if not months if I don\\'t go down there.

              "       'We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster. it usually works out quite differently here than when you say \"PM me anytime\" in a casual social context. \\n\\nWe have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves. We\\'re hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start. \\n\\nOur new wiki page explains in detail why it\\'s much better to respond in public comments, at least until you\\'ve gotten to know someone. It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n###Summary###\\n\\n**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement. Either way, it\\'s unwise to trust them.** \\n\\n\\n\"PM me anytime\" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it\\'s just not a wise idea. Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.\\n\\n* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you\\'ll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you\\'ll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\\\\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet. \\n\\n* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don\\'t give their names and callers aren\\'t allowed to request specific responders. It\\'s much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole. Analogously, it\\'s much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole. Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone. It\\'s partly about availability, but it\\'s mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. \\n\\n* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it\\'s much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**. (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can\\'t see or police PMs.) \\n\\n* In our observation over many years, the people who say \"PM me\" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively. Community input mitigates these limitations. **There\\'s no reason why someone who\\'s truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**. If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma. \\n\\n* We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others. These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they\\'ve primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone\\'s in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.\\n\\n* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don\\'t recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.',\n",

I鈥榤 Irish but my family moved to France when I was 5 and that is where I have lived since.\\nI grew up in a small country village, the school had only two classes. I hardly spoke French but I got a friend very quickly, I鈥檒l call her Honey in this post.\\n So Honey and I were friends all our childhood, we were in the same class every year and we were also neighbors so we played together every day after school. Year after year I became bilingual in French and made lots of friends, but I started to have a crush on her.\\nWhen I was 11 we started middle school, we were still in the same class and all our classmates were trying to get us together, but we were pretty shy at that time so we didn\\'t dare to 芦 flirt 禄. Finally it was the following year, when I was 12 years old, that we got in relationship. Ofc the feelings I had for her weren鈥檛 as strong as those I had for her when we grew up up because we were still young but I was so happy. She was the first girl I kissed, the only one actually.\\nWe kept growing up, we were always in the same class every year and we kept spending all of our time together. If I explain that, it鈥檚 so that you understand that from my 5 to 19 years I almost spent every day of my life with her, she gradually became as essential as breathing for me. The more the years went by, the more 芦 serious 禄 (important to each of us) our relationship became. We never argue, ofc sometimes we didn鈥檛 agree with each other but we knew how to put our differences aside and respect the point of view of the other.\\nThen when I was 15 we started high school, at that time we were in a relationship for almost three years and people were amazed by the longevity of our couple, because at that age it鈥檚 unusual.\\nBut we loved each other so much (and I still love her so much), it was like I had found the perfect person to me and I don\\'t want to speak for her but I felt like I was perfect to her. We kept growing up, we did our first time together (and all the others, I never had sex with another girl). We wrote long love letters to each other, any pretext was good to say how much we loved each other. I mean, I\\'m kinda that clich茅 of the chunk rugby player, people don\\'t really imagine me doing that, yet for her I鈥榙 have done anything and everything, she was so exceptional, I felt incredibly privileged to be part of her life.\\nWe graduated high school and that summer we moved into our apartment, then started university. I was so glad to live with her, to sleep with her every night. Of course our parents let us sleep together on weekends and holidays but it wasn鈥檛 the same, it was a new step in our relationship and we were so happy.\\nWhen I explained to my new mates from the university that I had been with my girlfriend for 6 years they were stunned, they asked me if I had never wanted to flirt with another girl or anything and the answer has always been no : since my childhood, I grew up alongside this exceptional girl and I always dreamed of being with her and I felt so lucky to be in a relationship with, I never even noticed any other girl. I found her perfect in every way.\\nWe were so happy. I just want to tell you a little bit about the great person she was. She was so heart warmed, she couldn鈥檛 stand injustice. She always wanted to help others. She was so kind and caring. Whenever our friends needed advice or support for something she was the one they call, she was full of wisdom and good intentions. She was always smiling, she illuminated people\\'s lives with her presence. She was a very funny person as well. She always saw the bright side of everything, she was so positive. She never gave up, she worked hard to reach her goals. She was so clever, I鈥檇 even say brilliant, she was a very gifted student. She was passionate : when she did something she put her whole heart into it. She made people feeling special, she knew how to bring out the best in them. She always complimented everyone, she was adorable. She was also sensitive, she hated seeing the ugly things of the world, she could cry for that. But she was also someone who made the world more beautiful by her mere presence. I鈥檝e never met someone so selfless and altruistic. She was also incredibly beautiful, the most beautiful woman I鈥檝e ever seen. She was an angel, for her friends, for her family, for me, for my family who loved her too. My mam has three sons and she was used to say that Honey was like her daughter. My little brother was kinda an hooligan when he was younger and listened neither to my parents nor to me. She spent so much time helping him, because of her he really took control of his life again.\\nEveryone loved her, literally. She was wonderful. She was someone who loved to pamper people. She could spend weeks making a gift or a surprise for someone, but she was always embarrassed when someone gived a gift to her. I think she was one of the few people who was sincere when they said they preferred to give than to receive.\\nI felt so good with her, she was the love of my life, literally. I always wondered how she could love me so much, I mean I鈥榤 not that bad and I always did my best especially for her but she was so much better than me. And yet she still looked at me like I was one of the wonder of the world.\\nWe were so happy. I was only 19 years old and yet I saw my life with her and she saw her life with me, we had lots of plans. And even beyond me, she was a great person, who was so young and had her life ahead of her. I mean, if we had broken up, it鈥檇 have been incredibly hard but at least she would have kept existing, living, shining as she deserved. But I cannot bear what happened.\\nWe were together, so happy and in love, I never could have believed that she will disappear so quickly and in such a brutal way. No one deserves that and when it happens to someone so close to you, someone you love so much, it鈥檚 extremely harsh.\\nIt was a Sunday and we were at our parents鈥� for the weekend. Sometimes on weekends we slept together and sometimes we slept on our own and we just spent the day together.\\nOn Saturday evening we slept each on our own, her at her parents鈥� and me at mine, there wasn鈥檛 even a particular reason. On Sunday morning she wanted to run for an hour and offered me but I was lazy. I was tired, I wanted to stay in bed an hour more. It鈥檚 absurd : I was studying sports science and I was too lazy to go running. I鈥榙 never forgive myself.\\nIt鈥檚 an ongoing case so I鈥檓 not allowed to speak in detail about it and anyway it doesn鈥檛 have to be, but she was violently assaulted and tortured and died, and then her body was burned. Suspects were arrested a few weeks later, it was in Feb 2019 and the trial was supposed to be in May 2020 but it was postponed because of the coronavirus (France is in quarantine).\\nI cannot even describe the infinite pain I felt when a few days after his disappearance, while very important research was being carried out, her body was finally found and we knew what had happened to her, I had a blackout.\\nSince I woke up from this fading away I have been taking heavy psychotropes, that doesn鈥檛 prevent me from constantly having anxiety attacks and having to take a fuck ton of sleeping pills to sleep, otherwise I have awful nightmares. I never thought I鈥榣l fall so low one day, I have always been someone very happy and full-blown. But I never thought that the love of my life was going to be murdered one day either.\\nI haven\\'t been going to university since, I don\\'t do anything except think about her all day, I saw a lot of therapist but they only say shit, how am I supposed to accept the sudden death of the person I love the most in the world and with whom I grew up believing that we were going to spend our lives together ? They tell me about the emotions of mourning but the only emotions I have are deep feelings of hopelessness and hatred towards those who did this.\\nI feel even worse since I know who did this and what their \"reasons\" were, because they were people I knew. I feel devastated. Sometimes I want to kill myself and sometimes I want to avenge her by killing them. But I feel unable to inflict this pain on my parents, who are very friends with Honey\\'s parents (They had been friends for a long time before, because we are neighbors) and who help them a lot to hold on since it happened, I can see that they have the fear is that I kill myself and to be in the same state as the parents of Honey.\\nHer parents are suffering so much, they lost their only daughter and I don\\'t know what to do to relieve their pain. Whenever I speak with them they seem so happy all of a sudden, they say that Honey kept living through me. But imo it\\'s not true, she no longer lives and will never lives again and I miss her so, so much. But I know if they say that it鈥檚 because they miss her so much too. She is missed by everyone who knew her, she was so wonderful. And I will always miss her.\\nPeople tell me that one day when I鈥檒l be happy again and I鈥榣l meet someone else and go back to normal life. But I know it鈥檚 wrong, first I鈥榣l never be happy again, how am I supposed to live without her after growing up with her ? She was as essential to me as breathing, it鈥檚 unbearable to survive since she鈥榮 no longer there, how can I resume a normal life ? And how can I meet someone else ? I never wanted when I was happy and she was there to meet someone else so it isn鈥檛 now that I鈥榤 desperate without her that I鈥榣l want to meet someone, plus she is irreplaceable. I feel devastated. She is the only one I want and yet I know she鈥榣l never come back. I constantly think of her, of her laughter, her smile, her scent. I bought her perfume and I spray it on my pillow every day, I know it\\'s stupid but it\\'s the only thing that helps me sleep a little better. I just wanna hug her again. Sometimes when people lose a loved one they say they regret not telling them how much they mean to them and at least I鈥檓 芦 relieved 禄 that Honey knew how much I loved her and how important she was to me when she passed away, because I told her every day.\\nJust before the quarantine there was a commemoration for the one year of her death and everyone looked at me with pity. As I no longer go to class, in rugby or to see my friends I don鈥檛 see anyone and I had not seen some people for several months, they were dazed by my appearance. And I hadn\\'t realized but actually I became the shadow of myself, I always was very 芦 strong 禄 and now I鈥榤 extremely bony. It depressed me even more to see how many people seemed concerned when they saw me. That\\'s why I avoid my friends, they don\\'t know what to say (and I understand that\\'s normal, in their place I wouldn\\'t know what to say either) and they鈥榬e also embarrassed not to know what to tell me.\\nThe only person I used to open up to is Honey, and now having to deal with such difficult emotions without knowing to who open up is very painful. My family is trying to support me as much as they can but it\\'s very hard, there was a very bad atmosphere at home, so much so that my parents broke up and my father went back to Ireland with my older brother. I feel like my mom and little brother don\\'t know what to do with me anymore. But I don\\'t know what to do with me either. I think that after the trial I鈥榣l go to Ireland for a while as well, just to take a break, here every time I go out everyone is aware of what happened, throughout the region (and even outside, but here they recognize me so they look at me with that pitying air that depresses me even more).\\nI鈥檓 not afraid of the judgement, I know they鈥榣l have a long sentence but I鈥榤 very afraid of the trial in itself and to, during a week or two to, hear what she has been through in detail all day, to see her murderers and to hear what they鈥榬e going to say, I鈥榤 anxious I cannot bear it. For the moment I鈥檓 trying not to think about it. I spend all my time in the tree hut that his father built between our gardens when we were younger. We spent all our time there, when we were teenagers and our parents didn鈥檛 want us to sleep together we secretly met there and stayed all night. Everything remained as it鈥檚, when I鈥檓 there I feel calmer.\\nI feel like nothing can ever ease my pain, I don\\'t even know why I came to tell my story here.

Never have the money.) I check my bank account and realize that all of the bills I had planned to come out last week all hit at once and put our account into the negative. By quite a bit. I panicked. My wife had been looking forward to a small trip to Chattanooga to just relax for MONTHS. The kid was to stay at my parents house and we were just going to relax for a few days. When I realized I\\nmessed up the timing on our bills, I spiraled. I absolutely lost control and cried. Lost it. It was probably the worst I have ever felt. I was crying for about 10 minutes when I suddenly had this sense of calm wash over me. Suicide. Easy. I got out of bed, suddenly stoped crying, cleaned my face up and began getting dressed. I told my wife I was going out for a little while. She knew something was going on and refused to let me leave the house. She physically grabbed me, made me look her in the eyes and told me everything was fine. It brought me out of my head. I don鈥檛 know if it鈥檚 something that I would have gone through with, but in that moment it was the most ok I had ever been with the idea of suicide.

I *am* from a rich family, people have always expected me to be on top of everything ever since I learned to walk, but I was never able to be on top. I've always sucked at everything. I tried to be on top, but never made it. And so now I'm this 21 year old uni student. And I've been hammered so much with that mindset of trying to get to be best at everything, and since I've always failed at that, I feel safer as a failure. I just *do not* feel that I want to succeed. I've become an emotional masochist. Sometimes I imagine that a loved one would come and choke me to death to put me out of this misery and leave me in a cold dead end where no one would ever come across again.

I raced down the hill, gaining more and more speed, by the time I reached the bottom, my car (which only has a speedometer for up to 200 km/h. I saw the road start to bend and I jerked my wheel into the opposite direction of the turn, slamming the front end of the car into the median. That was the last thing I remembered before waking up in my car, with tapping on the window from bystanders. All I could think to myself at that moment was \"wow, I so much of a failure I can\\'t even kill myself\". A bystander described to the paramedics and police that I hit the median, did about 10 spins (no flips) and then continued to scrape median down the hill for another 250m. I got a glimpse of my car before I was taken away in an ambulance, it was completely destroyed. When I arrived to the hospital I was placed in the trauma room however, the doctor was incredibly surprised after seeing me sitting upright with consciousness after a 200 km/h car accident. He assessed me and ordered a full-body CT scan. The results came back clean, no bleeding, no broken bones and most importantly, no death. He then admitted me to the psychiatry ward (which I won\\'t get into on this post but it was a nightmare!!!).\\n\\nThe everyone\\'s surprise I was barely injured, walking away with a concussion with memory loss at most. This phrase really stuck in my mind because nearly every person I have talked to so far has said: \"It\\'s a miracle you\\'re alive\". I\\'m not religious, but I agree, it is a miracle I\\'m alive, and I\"m not going to waste it. I\\'m begging for help because I know this community loves to help people when they reach out. I really want to try and beat my depression but I don\\'t know how. I have tried CBT, I\\'m going BACK to ECT for another round of treatment and I\\'m on increased medication. I will be seeing counsellors and psychiatrists, however thanks to Canadian healthcare not until 2020 (which is one of the reasons I decided to end it, due to lack of resources).\\n\\nIf anyone out there has any tips on how to manage severe depression and anxiety please let me know. I\\'m still alive today despite the severity of the crash, and I believe it\\'s a sign that I need to conquer this depression and do something great with my life. I am tired of laying at home, with no energy and no motivation, wasting away my life every day with my depression. I can personally say even those who are suiciding don\\'t want to die, they merely just want to stop existing.\\n\\nPlease help with any advice you have, I\\'m begging for my life to change, please. I am trying my best to push past my depression and suicidal thinking so I can give life another try.\\n\\nHere are a list of specific questions that would benefit a lot:\\n\\n\\\\-How do I keep up my motivation despite having no energy all the time?\\n\\n\\\\-How can I keep up or have more energy?\\n\\n\\\\-I\\'m thinking of going back to school for Nursing, my current position (lab tech) doesn\\'t feel fulfilling and I\\'m looking for something more. Is nursing school a good idea or will that just make my life more stressful?)\\n\\n\\\\-What are some habits I could do to alleviate my depression\\n\\n\\\\-Any secret self-help/feel good tips?\\n\\n\\\\-How do I make more friends and build a better support network?\\n\\n\\\\-What do I tell to my friends who have noticed I just \"disappeared\" for a few days?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThanks to those who took the time to read this post, I usually get little to no reads on Reddit but I thought I\\'d share this anyway since not many people can say they survived a 200 km/h automobile suicide attempt and walked out with minor injuries. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.\\n\\nEdit: more questions\\n\\nEdit 2: Thank you, everyone, for taking the time to write to me. I truly didn\\'t believe this would reach this many people. I will try and reply/read everyones post but I am still in the process of seeing a lot of specialists. But I am truly grateful for all the love and support that has been sent my way. Thank you, I will make you all proud and try my best to implement all of the tips into my life.',\n",

Firstly the cost- I鈥檓 an Aussie and I have private health insurance, which includes ambulance cover, so it cost me nothing. I can鈥檛 believe some people have to pay. I wouldn鈥檛 have called if I knew I did. Second - what happened after I called. I had my live in boyfriend with me, and they came in and asked me some questions (eg had I overdosed / self harmed etc.) I explained that I had accidentally missed a few days of my medication, and then had several extremely stressful incidents occur over the space of the days I forgot them. I called because I started to feel like I couldn鈥檛 trust my brain, and I had a plan I was worried I would act on when my partner left for work in the morning. I had also had a panic attack right before I called, which I had never had before and oh boy was that scary. So off I went. It was all very gentle and calm. I basically just needed someone to watch me while I waited it out / for my meds to kick in. I slept in a nice room, was allowed to keep my phone so I keep in touch with my partner. In the morning I was given my meds (I had remembered them the dish before). I had various meeting were they explained that they were happy I called, it was just a relapse, forgetting my meds didn鈥檛 help. I had a long meeting with a doctor where I went through everything (I was first diagnosed 5 years ago with PTSD and depression) and the difficulties I鈥檝e had getting help. I had a good doctor for a while, but she moved. So they set me up with a new doctor with hours the work in my work schedule, and a new therapist, again that work in my work schedule (most psychs in my area that bulk bill don鈥檛 do after 9-5) (bulk bill = in Australia medical services and partially covered by our public health system (Medicare) is the doctor only charges what they cover, it鈥檚 referred to bulk billing. Basically it鈥檚 free (but covered by your tax dollars)) They also renewed my mental health care plan (my document a doctor gives that allows me to access the psyc services at little to no cost) which I hadn鈥檛 been able to renew as my new doctor couldn鈥檛 fit me in. Lastly I was put in touch with a community mental health program a few streets from me who have given me a case worker. I haven鈥檛 meet her yet, but basically she鈥檒l contact me regularly to see if I鈥檓 ok, and can be the person to find me doctors and psychologists when I鈥檓 struggling too. I鈥檝e nicknamed her my depression pa. Lastly they recommended I get my dosage upped a little bit. Then I was realised (it was about lunch time) and got sushi. They also rang my boyfriend a lot (plus me texting him a selfie every 30 minutes on his request) to keep him updated, and to run down my plan moving forward.',\n",

I\\'ve been diagnosed with depression and PTSD and I\\'ve gone to the hospital twice over suicide attempts because every time I\\'m with my dad I want to kill myself. He pushes me to the limit and I\\'m afraid that. \\n\\nEver since I was little, my dad has always beaten me with a belt. Even before I was old enough for school. My dad has beaten me for not doing what I was told to do. He yells curse words at me and uses my mother as an example of what not to be. And that makes me feel sad because I miss my mom. Recently, my grades dropped. I\\'ve been having problems at school. I have a hard time focusing and paying attention to what I\\'m being taught. My dad was pissed. One moment he鈥檚 screaming at me and cursing me out and telling me I won\\'t achieve anything in life. And telling me I\\'m going to regret it when he鈥檚 done with me.\\n\\nMy 11 year old brother also made a bad grade, so he walked into my brothers room and I heard screaming and loud sound from my dad hitting him with a belt. Then he walked up to me and told me to give him my hand. I held my hand out and he hit me extremely hard with the belt. I screamed and held my hand, but he told me to hold my hand out again he continue to do it over and over again.\\n\\nThen he told both of us to come in the kitchen. He started yelling at us saying he was in an \"ass whooping mood\" and that he\\'d beat us whenever we felt like it. That if we didn\\'t care about our grades he wouldn\\'t care either. That he\\'d make us feel his pain. He hit me extremely hard. My hand was red and swollen. I had a bruise on my wrist that was slightly swollen and stung to the touch. He told me to hurry and wash the dishes before he\\'d do it again. And he did. But my hand hurt too badly. He threatened to hold me down.\\n\\nI\\'m going to kill myself if I have to continue to live with him. I cannot take this anymore and no one will do anything about it, I decided that when I go back to my mom\\'s on Sunday I am refusing to go back to my dad\\'s. This is what it\\'s come to because he refuses to cooperate and my mom doesn\\'t have enough money to get a lawyer and free legal aid takes too long. So I am not going. I know my dad will call the police if I don\\'t go. When they come, I will talk to them and tell them my situation.\\n\\nCan they force me to go? What will they do? Because in order to get me to go they would have to physically drag me. I am in fear of my life and I don\\'t want to die but he just pushes me to that limit so I just can\\'t be around him. I don\\'t know how many times I\\'ve tried to tell my dad this and even my therapists have tried to tell him this.\\n\\nHe doesn\\'t care, he simply denies treating me the way he does saying he\\'s never called me the things he does on a daily basis like dumbass, idiot, son of a b\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*, and he even calls my brother those things and denies it. Then when we\\'re in public or around other people he acts like a totally sweet person, and his girlfriend thinks that I\\'m the problem because he constantly complains about me when really it\\'s just a big show.\\n\\nWhat will the cops do about it when they come?',\n",

These are just a few examples.\\n\\nI had my sister calling me talking about her boyfriend who just drinks all the time and does nothing, and she was complaining about how she hates where she works. I tell her to get rid of the man and get a job somewhere else. It wasn\\'t as short as it sounds. I listened to her and gave her serious advice, though I know she won\\'t take it because she never does. Instead of thanking me, no one ever does, she tells me that it\\'s easy for me to tell her to just get another job because I don\\'t have one and can just sit around and sleep. Well, thanks, I just love sitting around and thinking about my crappy life; it is a positive joy. We hadn\\'t spoken until her son ended up in an issue and, of course, the family therapist (me) gets a text, asking me to talk to her son and try to get him to listen to \"reason\". I agree just because I know my nephew doesn\\'t get good support from her. Come to find out, she\\'s mad because he\\'s dating some girl who has a kid already. I can\\'t say it\\'s great at his age, but he\\'s also an adult, so I just told him to be careful, watch out for emotional abuse, and reminded him of his last relationship, which was like a copy of his mom\\'s relationships; she doesn\\'t realize he gets his bad examples from her. After talking to him, his mom texts me and is like, \"I\\'m getting off work in a few hours, I\\'ll call and we can do a three-way call and talk to him.\" Nowhere did she ASK me if this was okay, didn\\'t ask if I was busy or anything, but as with most of my family, since I\\'m at home, I never have anything important to do, so they just tell me to do stuff instead of asking, like I\\'m a human being. I tell her I texted him and I was still recovering and needed to sleep. She didn\\'t ask me what I was recovering from, if I was okay, nothing. Just said, \"Okay, night.\" \\n\\nMy niece had trouble at school and she\\'s a lot like my sister, unable to let go of things. She\\'s upset because some girl at school wants to fight her because my niece took her chair. A chair this girl wasn\\'t using, mind you, but that was just sitting next to her. My niece calls me, upset and frantic over this because the girl won\\'t let it go and went to the office and had my niece called out of class because the girl wanted an apology. My niece refused because she said she hadn\\'t even done anything and she went to the principal, who told her that the girl is known for \"keeping things going\", so she wouldn\\'t be bothered again, but my niece wouldn\\'t get off the phone until I promised to stay up until she got out of school in case they call her into the office again and she wanted me to talk to them. A huge reason I don\\'t have kids is so I don\\'t have to deal with the stress of dealing with teachers and other parents, yet I have to be a parent to my niece because my sister won\\'t be. Mind you, I had just come back from the doctor, had been hopped up on pain meds and wanted to do nothing, but sleep. I forced myself to stay awake, but thankfully, no one called.\\n\\nThen, my sister calls me and is crying, telling me how much she wants her boyfriend to leave the house. So, I don\\'t say anything and just let her talk. Finally, she\\'s like, \"I just don\\'t know what to do or how to get him out of my house.\" I told her to call the police; she doesn\\'t want to get him in any more trouble because he has a DUI because he drinks and drives. SHE allows him to drink and drive her car, because he doesn\\'t have one and doesn\\'t have a license. I won\\'t even touch how stupid that is. So, I get frustrated with her and tell her that I keep telling her how to get rid of him and she never listens, so I don\\'t know what she wants me to do. She acts like I offended her and is like, \"I just called to vent, can\\'t I vent, sometimes?\" I tell her that she can, but I\\'m tired of getting calls almost every week about this man; I\\'m not her therapist or life coach or anything, I\\'m barely hanging on by a thread a lot of days and hearing about this situation distresses me because, even if I don\\'t like her very much, I don\\'t want to hear about anyone dealing with this type of stuff. Not to mention, her best friend was killed just a few months ago by her boyfriend who was abusive and drunk a lot... make him leave before he gets to that point. Anyway, she accuses me of making it about me and hangs up. Maybe I did make it about me, but I want people to understand that I am not a therapist and I cannot fix their issues and I\\'m not emotionally well enough to take on all this stuff. I\\'m not sure anyone is, tbh.\\n\\nFinally, we come to today. My mother had to take me to the doctor because I couldn\\'t get there on my own and need support to get there. We\\'re talking about normal stuff, then she\\'s like, \"Aren\\'t you tired of just sitting at home and doing nothing? You really need to get out and get a life.\" I don\\'t ever like talking to my mom about my mental health because she acts like it\\'s a phase that should have been over in my teens and she doesn\\'t understand why I\\'m \"letting it bother me\" as an adult. I\\'d like to mention, she has horrible anxiety, as well, but she powers through it to work, at least, it still takes over her life. She also doesn\\'t do much outside of the house and has no life, but when I point that out, she brings it back to me. Anyway, I tell her I just paid all the bills and since the bills got higher, I don\\'t have money to have a life, even if I wanted to. So, then, she\\'s like, \"If you get a job, you\\'d have more money.\" I know this, but I have tried many times to hold a job; I cannot do it for more than a few days without having panic attacks and breakdowns, which either end up with me leaving or getting let go, which then leads me into a deep depression. She acts like I don\\'t try and this is even with medicine and therapy. Sometimes, I\\'m sure the main reason none of this works is because I\\'m around my family, but I never tell them that because I don\\'t want to deal with that fallout. At this point, I\\'m just tired of the conversation, so I don\\'t respond. Then, she brings up how I need to get some friends, at least... says the woman who literally has one friend and who got upset at my aunt for going out without her, even though she never goes anywhere when she invites her. Heavy eyeroll. Anyway, I tell her that I\\'ve tried to have friends; it\\'s not my fault they don\\'t put effort in and either they end up not talking or I fade out because nothing is happening. She asks me why I don\\'t hang out with the people I met last summer. The two girls I met last summer were nice, but one would rarely go out with us because she would rather stay in with her boyfriend, which left me and the other girl. We hung out a few times, but then she got a new trivia group and stopped texting me back, so I stopped texting her and let that fade out. This happens too often, so I stopped trying to make friends. I tell my mom that I don\\'t talk to them anymore, and she\\'s like, \"That\\'s your problem, you don\\'t try and cut people off so quickly.\" I texted the second girl every day for a week; she wasn\\'t working at the time and she was always posting snaps, so I knew she was available, I wasn\\'t going to keep texting for no reason. I try to have boundaries and get crapped on for them. Unfortunately, I am not one of those people who will keep trying and trying and trying when I see things obviously aren\\'t going along, anymore. She then goes into this long story about how she met her only friend and how they only talk like once a month, but they are still good friends and I need to be more \"realistic\" with friends. What good is a friend whom I only talk to for 10 minutes once a month and hang out with, maybe once every three months? If that works for her, great, but that\\'s not \"getting a life\" or anything else. Plus, I have a history of getting friends and then I become the \"therapy friend\" and I fade away because all they ever do is come around to dump their problems on me and get advice, then I don\\'t hear from them for months, when something else is going wrong. That\\'s not friendship, to me. \\n\\nAnd go back to my mom and my aunt. My aunt is mad at my mom for \"checking up on her\" at her age and, of course, I get pulled into it because my mom is being childish and won\\'t talk to my aunt, so I\\'ve been designated the go-between, but I never said I would be. They are 20+ years older than me, why am I even in this?\\n\\nI don\\'t know. I\\'m just tired of being everyone\\'s therapist and mediator. I keep trying to explain how draining it is. They obviously see I have my own issues, but they continually pour their issues onto me, expect sincere, helpful, empathetic responses, but let me feel bad or need something and everyone is busy or doesn\\'t answer their phones or I get \"advice\" that isn\\'t helpful. My niece and nephew would probably talk, but I don\\'t want to burden them with my issues; their mother does that to them enough, and they complain about it, to me, of course. What is it about me that makes everyone think I\\'m a therapist? Plus, none of them pay me for my services. That probably makes me more upset than anything; if I was a real therapist, I\\'d probably be rich off all these \"sessions\", lol.',\n",

I realize that I spent probably the first 18 years of my life. Living in literal fear of my pseudo racist father. I still remember being 6 years old or so and hearing my mother scream for my brother because my father was choking her in their bedroom. Was a big steroid fan back in the day. I spent most of my middle school and high school career grounded from one semester to the next one because I frequently got C鈥檚 in school which my parents would ground us for. Even one C on the report card and it was grounded for the rest of the semester. I still remember getting in trouble so badly for lying about doing my homework, not even so much for not doing my homework. But it was distinctly about lying about it. My father was beating me in our dining room and at one point was physically choking me against the wall, and I remember my mother saying 鈥渨ell Don鈥檛 choke him (insert name)鈥� and him looking straight at her with his hands around my neck saying 鈥淚鈥檓 not choking him鈥� I still remember that same night him having to come in my room to change my ice packs on my swollen face and how petrified I was that the gameboy sp I was playing was flung off the bed in a room with no carpet because I was certain I was going to get beat again. I remember going to school the next and having to tell my teachers (because all six of them forced me to stay after class and talk about it) that I was playing football with my brother and fell on a sprinkler. Funny how their response to me lying about homework was to in turn go to school and lie about why half of my face was swollen and black. I remember the first time i was ever caught shoplifting (was obviously my last time doing it too) when my dad came to pick me up, he was already so nasty to me before leaving the store that the police threatened to not let me leave because he was already trying to hit me in front of them. \\n\\nBut you know. Now that I鈥檓 an adult and have been jumped literally just because of my sexuality. If I鈥檓 going to get my ass beat I鈥檓 going to get my ass beat. I鈥檓 just not living in fear anymore. }}}}\\n\\n\\n {my thoughts on my brother}\\n\\n{{{{Which brings me to my brother. Who as of lately might as well be dead to me. We have not currently spoken since April, and as far as I鈥檓 concerned we probably won鈥檛 ever speak again. Let鈥檚 start with me saying I feel like my brothers relationship with me has always been from the start. Me bailing him out when he needs it. I remember being in elementary school and him getting to go back to sleep after my mother woke us up for breakfast and would leave for work, because it was my job to 鈥渨ake him up after rugrats鈥� when he was about 12 or 13 he got mixed up with a bad neighborhood kid and ended up almost lighting an entire house on fire in our neighborhood. The police officers were nice enough to offer him the deal that if you stay out of trouble until you鈥檙e 18 this will be completely removed off your record with no trace of it ever even happening. Sure enough he starts smoking weed in high school (which is back when it was HIGHLY frowned upon) and guess who had to take every single drug test for his four years of high school. My dumb ass. Bailing him out again. Until finally he got caught coming back late from lunch (upper class men were at the time allowed to leave campus for lunch) and he came back with a hotboxed car and didn鈥檛 air it out. So when the principle stopped him to ask why he was late she was literally hit with a cloud of smoke. My brother was the sole reason my high school was no longer allowed to leave campus for lunch. My brother and father have always had an awful relationship too obviously all this places even more tension on it, and eventually lead to him either being kicked out or leaving. I don鈥檛 remember which. Being on the streets on his own he was arrested more times for carrying stupid large amounts of weed on him because he sells it, and eventually got charged I think with robbery. Then to top it all off, a few years ago my brother got mixed up in the flocka epidemic. And of course there鈥檚 my dumbass bailing him out again being forced to put two stolen bikes in my car and drive him to Miami. \\nWhen I first started realizing how much I hated him was I think my senior year of high school. My parents had gone out of town leaving him in charge. I remember distinctly it was the night before vans warped tour he鈥檚 in a huge fight with his at the time girlfriend, because he was literally hitting either her, or her and/or her kid. And I remember he stormed into my room flinging open the door trying to use me as an excuse 鈥渋sn鈥檛 this okay because it鈥檚 what dad used to do to us. 鈥� of course having a criminal record he couldn鈥檛 find a job and was on probation at my parents house and because nobody wanted to hire somebody with his record they literally gave him a fucking job at the company my father works for. This job is 15$ an hour, gets benefit and vacation days. I on the other hand spent years being treated like shit in jobs. Two years ago I worked for quiksilver over the course of about a year, finally left because they told me and a coworker that we were the ones being considered for management and yet they brought in two outside hires after the second one the other coworker had the sense to leave. My dumb ass stayed thinking well now that she鈥檚 gone it鈥檒l look better on me. Which is when they brought in another outside hire. Who I was eventually cool with. I just stopped offering to do the management work for sales associate pay. Until I finally got so fed up that I transferred to GameStop because they were willing to start me as a keyholder since I already had basic management training. So two years trying to work for a manager only to be shit on by my parents because it鈥檚 not full time and 鈥渁t your age your brother worked full time鈥� at my age y鈥檃ll gave him a fucking career because nobody wanted to hire a literal criminal. Anything I do It鈥檚 just never going to be good enough. \\n\\n\\nLet me talk about our most recent altercation, because it鈥檚 a fantastic transition into my mother, as of last April I was unfortunately unemployed thanks to this whole virus outbreak, and of course that sets off my family members because I sleep all day while they work. So my mother asked me on April 20th the day before my birthday (a day that I was operating on approximately 2 hours of sleep because I鈥檓 always up all night) if I could go help my brother in the warehouse where he works because he really needs it. I have already had altercations with my brother there from helping him a previous time. It was so bad that they sent me home early. So being there in general makes me uncomfortable. Even when I go in to help my dads department. So of course I didn鈥檛 want to help which wasn鈥檛 an acceptable answer to my mother and after about the 5th time of her saying something obviously I snapped and agreed to which she responded 鈥渇orget it鈥� and slammed my door shut. (It should be noted that in my mother鈥檚 defense I鈥檓 a nightmare to wake up because of how little I sleep. There are times I wake up and am in a fight with my mother because she apparently tried to wake me up and I was nasty, meanwhile I have literally no recollection of even speaking to her ) so my dumb ass trying to bite the bullet agrees to go work for eight hours in a hot sweaty warehouse with barely any ac on my birthday of all days. I woke up that morning still mad about the fight I had with my mother the day prior because I feel like as a grown ass adult I should be allowed to say no I don鈥檛 want to do something. \\n\\nGet to the warehouse work the shift, I leave at five, which apparently was a mistake because I wasnt supposed to leave until 5:30 which I thought was fine because 1) I genuinely thought they left at 5 every day and 2) I didn鈥檛 take a lunch break because I was hoping if we happened to get everything done early we would just be able to leave. Obviously that was wrong and I got a shitty passive aggressive text message from my brother.\\n\\nHaving already been in a bad mood from my fight with my mother the day before partnered with my brother annoying me after I had left I stopped by aunts house to vent because I was literally seeing red. Wasn鈥檛 even planning on going home for my birthday because I just didn鈥檛 want to be around any of them. \\n\\n\\nThe next day comes and I don鈥檛 show up because not only did I not want to be there, but when I had gotten there the day before another employee of that company said 鈥渨e don鈥檛 know if we鈥檒l need you tomorrow or not yet鈥� so I just didn鈥檛 bother to show up because if y鈥檃ll needed me you should have worked that into your text message when you were being an asshole in my opinion. So of course my petty ass isn鈥檛 going to show up. My brother comes home through the door doesn鈥檛 even put his shit down and is in my face screaming at me for not showing up 鈥渨hy should I have to explain to my boss why you didn鈥檛 come鈥� 鈥渨hy do you get to sleep all day while we work I鈥檓 sick of it鈥� turning to my mother 鈥淚鈥檓 sick of him aren鈥檛 y鈥檃ll sick of him鈥� (to which she agrees probably just trying to get him to calm down, but I won鈥檛 ever for a second forget you just said you were sick of me. ) and of course I鈥檓 running my mouth back in return, which is when he decided to put his hands on me, shoving me literally to the floor. And this is about where I Black out with anger because I had my Nintendo switch in my hand. The limited edition no longer in production animal crossing themed one at that. So obviously I鈥檓 pissed and yank his PlayStation out of the wall and slam it on the ground. You can skip the next parentheses part if you don鈥檛 care about why a stupid video game console made me so upset.\\n\\n(A detour to mention about these video game consoles. My brother and I used to exclusively use Xbox but I made the transition to the PS4 when it came out. My brother didn鈥檛. I had been asking for a PlayStation 4 since they came out for both my birthday and Christmas for I think like two years. Until the year my brother spent Christmas in jail because he was addicted to flocka. When my mom finally bailed him out because she felt like he was actually clean, he got a PlayStation 4. When I asked why he got one and I didn鈥檛 despite it literally being the only thing I asked for as a Christmas gift, she said 鈥渨ell he wasn鈥檛 here for Christmas so I had to make it special.鈥� I think I eventually got the PlayStation for my birthday the following year. But this fucking switch man. I swore up and down when I was a GameStop employee that they were going to make an animal crossing version and they all laughed at me said if it was going to happen it would have already and talked me into buying just a standard switch instead. Low and behold a few weeks later the animal crossing one is announced and I鈥檓 lowkey heartbroken that I just spent a majority of my money on the standard one. I eventually get myself so worked up over it that I asked my mom to front me the money to buy the new system, and I will give her 200 when I sell my switch and the rest from my next paycheck. She鈥檚 talking some I can鈥檛 I don鈥檛 have that kind of money, which would have been totally fine. I was just embarrassed that I not only put my pride away to ask for money, but was also upset enough about not getting the animal crossing one to even be in this situation. So whatever whatever we end up agreeing on if I sell the console first and give her the two hundred she will give me the rest. Where as I was only asking her for the front because I didn鈥檛 want to risk selling my console before the new one came out and risk then not having a console at all. Especially since I had already missed like two years of the switches lifespan. So obviously I鈥檓 super thankful to my mom and I literally spent like two days thanking her and talking to her about it, only for me to find out that she had given me my own money. I don鈥檛 know what it was for, possibly my unemployment since the console came out around the time the virus was starting to flare. And at that point all I can keep thinking is wow. You really kept my own money from me, made me gamble on being able to find a limited edition console without a preorder. And told me you couldn鈥檛 loan me anything. That makes me so mad. How are you going to lie about my own damn money. Serves me right I guess for not being adult enough to stop using our joint bank account.) \\n\\nAnyway. I slam his PlayStation on the ground after he put his hand on me the first time we get into a screaming match in his room to which I say something along the lines of 鈥測ou鈥檙e allowed to knock my switch out of my hand so why should you expect any different of your PlayStation鈥� to which he responds (talking out of his ass) 鈥渨ell you didn鈥檛 pay for it mom did!鈥� Jokes on you asshole not only did I pay for it entirely with my money but our mother literally withheld my own money from me and made it more difficult for me to get an already difficult to get console. This ends up with him coming back into my room because everyone in my family (myself included) has to have the last word in argument. Which leads to him putting his hands on me a second time except this time since there鈥檚 not a 400$ gaming system in my hand I pull his disgusting ass down with me.}}}}}\\n\\nThis whole fight somehow ends with me being kicked out of my house by my mother. \\n\\n {my thoughts on my mother}\\n\\n{{{{Fun fact. Maybe about a week before this my mother was begging me to stop going out despite taking precautions with a mask and specially made sanitizer consisting of primarily alcohol. Because they had a friend in critical condition from covid. This is the same woman who threw her kid out into streets during the first peak of this epidemic. (I鈥檓 in Florida so it is at this moment higher than that first peak because Floridians are trash) so I spend the next three or four day sleeping in my car doing whatever trying to manage on my own, spending what little money I had fixing the joycon drift on my switch that was non existent until my brother attacked me with it in my hand. One thing leads to another and I eventually end up back home. I asked my mom if we could start family therapy because I鈥檓 literally holding onto grudges that I don鈥檛 know how to let go of. She says when all of this is over but I鈥檓 positive she鈥檚 forgotten about it and it might very well be what causes me to cut her out all together. \\n\\nA few days ago me and my mother got into a huge arguement because she woke me up to ask me to take her to firestone to pick up her car(I鈥檓 exhausted but totally not a problem to me at all) so I get right up get dressed grab my keys and when I walk out of my room she goes 鈥渁re you ready now I鈥檓 not in a rush or anything鈥� I was a little annoyed by the stupid question I鈥檒l admit, like you just two minutes ago came into my room to wake me up and ask me to take you. Yes I鈥檓 ready to go lol. Otherwise I鈥檇 still be asleep. She of course takes my flat response (a slight mixture of both my annoyance and exhaustion) as me being in a bad mood. So we get into my car and she鈥檚 overreacting because my car is a little shaky (which I鈥檓 almost positive is just because I need air in my tires) talking some oh my god we have to pull over what if you have a flat. Like we definitely would know if we were driving on a flat tire. It鈥檚 been doing this since like the second week I got this car. So I鈥檓 just sitting there trying to get to the destination as fast as possible trying to hold my tongue and not cause a fight when she sets me off and says something along the lines of 鈥測ou鈥檙e in a bad mood because I asked you to take me鈥� my response being 鈥渙h what I鈥檓 in a bad mood because I got right up to do something you asked me to do???鈥� which fucking infuriated me and caused a screaming match in my car. I don鈥檛 understand why she has this god complex where she thinks she gets to tell other people how they feel about something. She did it to me on my birthday too which I forgot to mention and am now too lazy to go back and add in. But like it drives me crazy. I don鈥檛 care if they鈥檙e right wrong or somewhere in between. Nobody has the right to decide how somebody feels about something except for that person. So when I sit there and tell you I鈥檓 not mad and you tell me 鈥測es you are mad that鈥檚 why you鈥檙e being shitty鈥� that鈥檚 a self fulfilling prophecy right there. Of course that shits going to make me mad. If you鈥檙e just going to decide I鈥檓 in a bad mood for me then shit I guess I鈥檓 in a bad fucking mood then. \\n\\nSo this screaming match in my car leads to her saying 鈥淚 hope something happens to your car, and when it does DONT call me鈥�. I will never ever in a million years forget she said that to me. I hope that when something does happen to my car, I鈥檓 inside of it, I hope it鈥檚 something fatal, and I hope she has to live with it for the rest of her life. And then of course after our screaming match she sends me a passive aggressive text message (because apparently my family is famous for doing that shit) talking some I won鈥檛 be screamed at in a car that I bought you, you are SO disrespectful the next time you talk to me like that you can find a new place to live! (As if she didn鈥檛 kick me out when I was 16, and 18, and 23. Like clearly I can manage in my car bitch try me. I would rather starve to death on the streets than feel like I need help from someone who treats me like shit) Skip the parentheses if you don鈥檛 care about context with my car history\\n\\n(Both me and my brother were fortunate enough to get cars for our 16th birthday. The difference between us is my brother has wrecked I think 2 cars my parents bought him, one car they gave him because my mom got a new car (which that one he wasn鈥檛 at fault for but still it鈥檚 a car to add to your tally) and ruined one of my dads trucks that he was using for whatever reason one day. I on the other hand drove the same car that I had since I was 16 until literally this year when I turned 25 and was given a new one. But honestly my parents had been trying to buy me another one for a few years I just fought them on it because I didn鈥檛 want a new car which I will explain why later. )\\n\\nAnd then now just today, we are in another arguement because I think last night, my brother walked out our back gate to go sell drugs in our mailbox because he thinks he鈥檚 cool and tough and can handle jail as if he isn鈥檛 literally crying 鈥渕ommy bail me out鈥� when he鈥檚 in there. As he鈥檚 going out he knocks over the ashtray I had been using over there (which was admittedly in the walkway but only because that particular night I was in a hurry to relocate under my backyard awning because it was raining and I had all my technology on me) but when he walks back he has the nerve to say to me 鈥測our ashtray is knocked over 鈥� as if i wasn鈥檛 outside and heard him kick it over like I鈥檓 supposed to lean up after him. Despite us having literally not a said a word to eachother since April. So I hid the ashtray that he normally uses with the mindset of 鈥渋f he needs an ashtray he鈥檒l have to go over and clean up the one he kicked over.鈥� Only for me to find that my mother ended up being the one to clean up his mess. Which of course infuriated me. And then she had the nerve to defend him in a text message after we got into an arguement about it. 鈥淲ell it is your ashtray...鈥� okay did I kick over my ashtray or did my brother. Because that鈥檚 the person who should have cleaned it up was who knocked it over. \\n\\nIn regards to my mother specifically it hurts me the most. Because I often at times feels like she鈥檚 the only one out of the 3 of my immediately family that I could have a relationship with or that I actively want to have a relationship with and that bridge is so close to being burnt to a crips. I don鈥檛 want to appear ungrateful because as a mother she does go above and beyond. I鈥檝e been spoiled sure. But my problem with it is, I feel like my mother only gives as much as she gives so that she has ammunition to hold over peoples head. I fought her for YEARS about getting a new because I knew she would just hold it over my head. Which obviously I was right about. I remember being kicked out when I was 18 because I wasn鈥檛 working and i had just gotten kicked out of college and she said leave your keys pack your stuff and find somewhere to live. So I did set off with no car no money no nothing ended up being taken in by my best friends family. Spent a year or two there, and I literally did not get my car back (the same one she had given me at 16) until the girl I was living with literally called her in tears asking if we could just borrow it so we could go see her mother who was in the hospital because she needed brain surgery. LITERAL BRAIN SURGERY was the only reason I got my car back. And it still took my friend like two or three times of asking my mother for her to let me use my car just to take her to see her mother. \\n\\nMy father has always babied me and let me get away with more than he lets my brother get away with I can admit that. The problem with it is, that because I don鈥檛 feel the same type of yearning for a relationship about my father that I do about my mother I don鈥檛 really care about him favoring me. And because my dad tends to let me get away with more my mom feels like she has to let my brother get away with more, which in turn causes me to always just feel like I鈥檓 chasing my mother鈥檚 approval or some shit. }}}}\\n\\n\\n\\n {thoughts on my own disgusting self}\\n\\nIt鈥檚 only been recently that I鈥檓 starting to come around to my father and that鈥檚 only because I think I鈥檓 starting to hate my mother. \\n\\n\\nI know I probably sound ungrateful and entitled. And I can see why. But I am truly thankful for how privilege I鈥檝e been and all that I鈥檝e been given. But I don鈥檛 know how to not feel the way that I feel about these things. \\n\\n\\nAnd that鈥檚 not to say I鈥檓 perfect either. I鈥檝e caused plenty of problem for my family. So let me just skip to all my flaws now. \\n\\nWhen I was a kid like before I could even start kindergarten I was literally already sucking dick. My next door neighbor ( my brothers age at the time) used to make me do it to him and I used to agree because he was considerably nicer to me when I do would so. He was already a problem child too but that鈥檚 neither here nor there. I was pretty much only sucking him off because my brother always hated when I would hang out with him and his friends, and the neighbor always let me hang around (for obvious reasons) distinctly remember my brother catching us a few times but I guess nothing was ever done about it. Not even sure if my parents know about it. \\n\\nBut as an adult I can see that鈥檚 where I started getting fucked up. Idk if I necessarily blame my neighbor for me being gay, because I do firmly as a gay man believe that it鈥檚 just who you are and can鈥檛 be changed, but I feel like there will literally always be a part of me that questions it. Like what if I wasn鈥檛 sucking dick at five years old, would I be interested in girls? I remember having a crush on at least two different girls before i met (what I now as an adult realize was probably my first boy crush) like looking back on my child hood I vividly remember playing 鈥渄octor鈥� with other kids or truth or dare that always ended sexual and I realize like damn. That鈥檚 fucking gross we were all kids. \\n\\n\\nFast forward to me being in I think middle school, and I was caught sexually experimenting with my cousin. I was definitely old enough to know better so I take fault there, but I also wasn鈥檛 ever the one initiating it. You know. I was letting him suck me off for longer than I can remember honestly, but I also distinctly remember I wasn鈥檛 the one initiating it. I still remember the first night at his house when he asked me to go pornhub and grilling him about how he even knows about that. I don鈥檛 remember when I started letting him do stuff to me, but I know that I shouldn鈥檛 have. I remember well enough that when he would come sleepover there were times I would opt to stay up late with my father in hopes that he would fall asleep waiting for me to come in. I remember one time I was up late and he comes walking out like 2 hours after being put to bed because he was trying to get me to come in to bed with him. But again I was the older kid in that situation. So that鈥檚 my fuck up. Obviously when we got caught it put a wedge between that side of our family. I can see why, but in hindsight I always wonder. Would you have still distanced yourself if you knew it was your son who had been initiating it? Because he was younger all the blame was pushed onto me. And I can see why. Again I should have known better. \\n\\nThat鈥檚 probably around the time I started getting fat. By high school at one point I was over 300 pounds and openly gay. Never had a serious relationship. Never even had someone interested in a relationship with me. I can see why. Not only was I cringey in high school but I was literally disgusting. It wasn鈥檛 till about my senior year I finally got back under 300 pounds and started losing some weight and gaining some confidence. \\n\\nBut here鈥檚 the kicker. Before I started losing the weight I had become a literal serial catfisher. And I鈥檓 talking like anybody you wanted to see naked I would go out of my way to target. Friends, friends boyfriends. Nobody was off limits to me. It makes me sick thinking about the hundreds of people I鈥檝e catfished because I was horny and lonely. Catfishing even basically got me kicked out of my college ( granted I was surprisingly innocent at that time but because the kid found out about me being a catfish he refused to believe it wasn鈥檛 me, despite me literally having to show my catfish accounts to the dean and them not matching up to whoever he was talking to. The college only realized their mistake a semester or two later because the kid was immediately put on academic probation the semester following my suspension, and then got caught trying to do the same thing to another gay student the semester after that. Which is when they were like wow we were wrong we鈥檙e so sorry don鈥檛 even worry about the requirements we gave you for coming back you can just come back never did though.) \\n\\nIt wasn鈥檛 only until I hit maybe 22 or 23 that it like clicked with how awful what I was doing was. And started making an active effort to stop it. And I feel like I was only even willing to because I fell in genuine love with somebody I was catfishing. When I finally told him, we were fine for a few days. He told me he didn鈥檛 care that I was a guy because he fell in love with the person behind a screen. But all of that quickly crumbled to ashes. That鈥檚 another one that鈥檚 my own fault. Not only was I doing something shitty but I was also in too deep. I think I still to this day get texted from somebody I started catfishing when I was about 15 or 16 that I just am too afraid to finally tell the truth to. \\n\\nBut since the recent heart break I鈥檝e thankfully been able to almost entirely remove catfishing from life save for the one guy I was in too deep with, and the old catfish accounts that I occasionally log into when I鈥檓 desperately alone/horny/whatever it may be. \\n\\nI鈥檓 tired of feeling alone. I just want to be loved. I want someone to want me. To care about me.\\n\\nI鈥檓 starting to realize this world is awful. Almost every thing and everyone in it is bleak. Some people genuinely want to live long happy lives, me personally, I don鈥檛 think I can make it doing this shit for another 25 years. Self deprecating jokes and suicidal humor are my biggest weapons. Because I feel like if I don鈥檛 turn them into jokes. I鈥檒l let them overcome me. Too many people in this world are awful. I don鈥檛 want to be one anymore. \\n\\n\\nI doubt any of you will actually care enough to read this through. But if you for some unknown reason did, then I thank you. Because I could really use a friend. \\n\\n\\n\\nTLDR; I鈥檓 a scumbag. I鈥檓 starting to think my family is scumbags, and I鈥檓 genuinely losing my will to live. I鈥檝e been holding on to grudges that are literally consuming me and transforming me into a being of hatred and it makes me sick to my stomach. I don鈥檛 know how much longer I can do this, but god I would absolutely love to just be taken out by a bus tomorrow.',\n",

Blue with a guitar on it, and a moon with stars in the middle of the guitar. It said made in 2020, Love Nikole. I almost cried in front of her which is something she's never seen me do. It just hit me so hard, like beyond words. My family is very loving but they mostly keep to themselves. I just thought to myself, how could I put her and everyone else through such a thing. Spent half the night crying like a little girl, I'm 34M. Still woke up feeling like garbage, but I dunno somethings different, I guess that feeling like someone's thinking of me is helping a bit. I can't say anything to her now but in the future I'm really gonna thank her for that. I still feel like I don't wanna be here, but whereas before it was 100%, now I'm slightly on the fence about it.

My interests fall in computer science, math, video games, and anime/manga. When I was younger I loved video games so much, and I still do to this day. Video games were the reason I was planning to work at a game development studio in the future. I felt more understood by VG鈥檚 than I did with my family. \\n\\nI鈥檓 not close with my family and I don鈥檛 ever will be because they are toxic af. I鈥檝e been psychologically abused and nobody would ever listen to my end of the story. They are the major cause for my depression, and some for my suicidal tendencies. As more time passed I would stay in my room as much as I can because I whenever I would step out, my parents would drag with them to some store, usually insult me, or whine about how lazy I am. My mom has been more abusive, but at the same time she is an idiot who I was able fool on a few occasions. My dad is annoying and racist. For some ungodly reason he hates white people, which makes me embarrassed to have him as a father. My stepmom is stupid and racist so I can鈥檛 stand her. Certainly least, my sister is a literal bitch, who has no regard for anyone鈥檚 feelings. \\n\\nSchool is the worst thing to have ever happened to me. I don鈥檛 even know where to begin with school because I have had so much shitty stuff happen to me. Elementary school was ok. I was easy target for harassment, but it鈥檚 not as bad as it was in middle school. When I was in elementary school, I never saw the importance of school. I barely did any work, and never bothered to pay attention in class. Almost everyday in elementary school, I just looked forward to going home and playing on my Nintendo DS. It was my major motivation back then.\\n\\nThen came middle school. This is where so many problems came to rise. Words cannot describe how horrible my middle school experience was. This is when school pressure really started hitting me and that I felt the need to work harder. I had only like one friend in the beginning of 6 grade, and by then I began getting bullied by having that friend. This friend of mine was seen as very strange and weird by every other student, but I defended him and decided to go through constant harassment so I can keep being his friend. One day at the end of the year, my science teacher decided to expose me In front of the class because she got so sick of me not turning my work. I don鈥檛 blame her though lol. Next is 7th grade where there was no end to bullying. Throughout the school year, I tried so hard to fit in and be like everyone else, but it really backfired making me look more like an idiot. I would do the most retarted shit just for attention because I felt so lonely. Worst idea ever. Now those memories are stuck with the other students who went to class with me. I asked I crush out and she rejected me (wasn鈥檛 much a big deal, but I did feel pretty embarrassed after). Almost all my friends were fake, and would easily turn their back on me. Whenever I was alone, thoughts of self harm would become more frequent, and whenever I wasn鈥檛 I was being harassed by someone. The last day of 7th grade is literally the worst day of my life. Completely lonely the first half, then, midday, I accidentally fell in some chalk that was on the concrete, and it ruined the clothes I was wearing that day. My 鈥渇riend鈥� saw this as the perfect opportunity to embarrass me in front of much other students as he can. Almost immediately when he found out, he literally started running around the school and tried to tell almost anyone nearby about how dumb I looked with chalk on my clothes. Students nearly when they saw me just gave a weird look or an expression of confusion. I was so suicidal that day. Next is 8th grade. Not as terrible as 7th, but still bad. I was admitted into a 9th grade biology class because of my great grades in 7th grade environmental science, but the biology class was horrible to be in. The teacher was absolute shit, and made it harder for us just for the sake of it. When I came in that class on the first day, I almost had a heart attack because there were so many students who were admitted in this class and I knew none of them. Some of the other students I sat with hated me because I got some of the concepts confusing. Insert some more embarrassing moments then you have 8th grade. High school is better then middle school, but I still hate school in general. 9th grade: I鈥檝e never been so lonely. 10th grade: My existential crisis began. 11th grade: suicide attempts. 12: burnout and more suicide attempts. I don鈥檛 want to treat life as a separate entity, but 2020 killed me this year. I wish I can just take a mental break, but my parents are denying my depressive symptoms. Doing schoolwork has never been so difficult holy shit. If I can鈥檛 even do it well in high school, then how can I do it college ? \\n\\nLife is so horrible. I get abused for the most minor things and I don鈥檛 know what to do anymore. I have no idea what to do for the future because I ruined my grades and I鈥檝e overthought what I want to be when I grow up. I attempted suicide like over 10 times this year, but none of them work. I don鈥檛 understand why people just won鈥檛 help me, even when I reach out. I wish my life just ended by whatever means. I don鈥檛 to be homeless especially at this because it鈥檚 insanely cold outside. My point is everything is just not fucking fair. I actively try do the most I can to rid depression and do my schoolwork, but nobody will fucking cooperate with me.

I just finished my third year of college and my third year of having absolutely no friends. I\\'m not the party type or anything, but it still is a bummer not to have a single friend to share the occasion with. Today I received three texts (more than most days): one from my mom, my dad and my cousin wishing me happy birthday. In all fairness, I don\\'t have a facebook and I don\\'t expect people to memorize by date of birth or anything, but it still feels really sad not to hear back from anyone. I guess I\\'ve never been comfortable with having a facebook, the idea of being so interconnected which each others\\' lives and making daily status updates is such a foreign concept to me. But I think in not having a facebook, I\\'ve sacrificed my social life absolutely. \\n\\nAnyways, I\\'ve spent the entire day in my room with the lights off trying to drink away the depression of today and of college. There is not a single person who if I called them right now, they would pick up and talk to me. I\\'ve been fighting with my parents and after a few shared \\'unpleasantries,\\' are not answering my calls because they want we \"to cool off,\" and understandably so. I\\'ve been \\'no contact\\' for ever a year with my girlfriend ( I knew from highschool) who I ended up dating long distance when we started college. Today, I made an attempt to call her (went to voicemail) to ask her if she\\'d let me take her out to lunch as friends to catch up but I haven\\'t heard from her. It really breaks my heart that I lost that person who was my best friend for a good part of my life. I assumed she would have remembered today was my birthday. I certainly didn\\'t forget hers. \\n\\nAnyways, If you\\'ve made it this far, from the bottom of my heart, thanks for listening to me vent. \\n\\n\\nEDIT: The Reddit community has been absolutely amazing. You guys have been sending me happy birthday wishes from all corners of the globe, I\\'ve been getting offers for people to buy me drinks, and some have even given me their cell numbers to talk/text me if I was still feeling down. You guys are unbelievable. You turned what was a miserable day for me into one of the most memorable birthdays I\\'ve ever had. From the bottom of my heart, thank you.

              "       'First of all ... I have hesitated for a long time just to write everything that burdens me, but maybe it helps just to get rid of everything once. \\n\\nAbout me, 31 years old, I am psychologically completely broken and physically unfortunately also very lediert. \\n\\nMy life has just gone wrong from the beginning and sometimes I wonder if some people are just lucky and others are not. \\n\\nI grew up in an already broken family. My mother was married 3x and divorced 3x (I am the child of the second husband). I can remember almost all the incidents of my childhood (which makes it worse for me) One of the first memories I have (about 3,5 years) my father went after my mother with a knife. And even stabbed through a door with a knife. He was then thrown out by my grandparents and I saw him only once a short time later. He was an alcoholic all his life and did not even try to contact me (even when my ex-wife met him by chance in the hospital 10 years ago and gave him my cell phone number...). Without my knowledge)\\n\\nIn the meantime he passed away about 2 months ago and I knew nothing about him except that he was an alcoholic. \\n\\nAfter he was no longer there, my mother had quickly met someone new, my stepfather. He was 8 years younger than my mother. \\n\\nUnfortunately, he was also very aggressive. As a chain smoker he was very quickly annoyed when he had no more cigarettes and has quickly become with things around him, it also did not take long and my mother and he have often and loudly quarreled, often thrown on dishes on the walls. He became unfortunately also now and then Handgreiflich and has beaten me and my brother (whereby my brother was rather his favorite, since he was older and could make more with him). After we have moved several times we lived in a townhouse only then it did not take long that my mother and my stepfather have also divorced. My stepfather had cheated on my mother for a long time with my cousin (yes it does not get better).\\n\\nAfter the separation, my stepfather has emptied the joint account and has filed for bankruptcy, because no one could keep the house alone, my mother also had to file for bankruptcy. \\n\\nShortly after that we moved of course, unfortunately my mother lost her job 3 years later and has never found a full-time job again and lives since then on social benefits. \\n\\nWith my brother (child of my first husband and 3 years older than me) I never had a really good relationship, mostly he didn\\'t want to have anything to do with me and we generally did less together. He was also not at the same school as me, he was never very educated unfortunately. \\n\\nHe also moved out quite early, because he did not get along with our mother at all and even resented that she separated from our stepfather (because he got along with him). He then moved to another cousin of ours until he was 18 and even had contact with our stepfather. \\n\\nGenerally he was always very strange. He watched our parents having sex or generally our mother taking a shower. (And played with himself while doing so). He is also said to have had sex with our cousin according to a friend of his. (Probably several times) And has often set fire with a friend together.\\n\\nHe somehow had a kind of mother complex and for many years always looked for much older women who often also had children. But usually it did not last very long. When it was over, he often set a fire somewhere. What I knew about afterwards was his own car, A garden shed, A meadow, and finally an attic of an apartment building, whereupon he was arrested and sentenced. However only on probation. \\n\\nHis last partner was 11 years older than him with whom he actually held out for 6 years. Only a short time later he had a partner 11 years younger (a complete change of heart). Which was then suddenly pregnant immediately, after the first child a few weeks later she was pregnant again. \\n\\nHowever I had in the people 10 years very very rarely contact with my brother and we have seen us actually only when our grandparents died (who have reached a proud age 92 and 94).\\n\\nIn general, I have also completely broken off contact in the meantime, because after several attempts on my part, no normal relationship can develop between us. I can not even have a reasonable conversation with him, because you just notice he seems to be very stupid (I just can not express it differently).\\n\\nAbout me .. I also made a lot of mistakes in life. \\n\\nUnfortunately for me, I almost didn\\'t focus on my schooling and did almost nothing in class (my mom didn\\'t care what I did or didn\\'t do anyway, she never showed up for a parent-teacher conference either). \\n\\nI wanted to earn money as fast as possible and learned the next best thing and ended up in the camp. My goal though was to become a soldier and joined the army after my training, unfortunately I got a slipped disc there and dropped out 2 years later. \\n\\nThen I ended up in a larger company where I had worked until today. \\n\\nI started drinking myself very early (15 years), because I myself had a very bad environment, the city I lived in generally had high unemployment and there was a lot of drug dealing. Also through my education I drank almost every day after work and it was later to the point that I completely shut down 4 times a week and had a blackout several times. This was no better in the armed forces. Was able to make the leap in my mid 20\\'s though and quit. I don\\'t even drink beer in between anymore because I just don\\'t feel like it. I also take my other drugs (although I sometimes wonder if maybe I should). Or smoke either.\\n\\nI have always tried in my life to escape into some relationships, because I could not be alone ... My first relationship lasted 5 years circa and I was married myself and had to divorce and have a son. \\n\\nMy ex-wife, however, always wanted to make life difficult for me and I got deeply into debt because of her, since she, among other things, never completed an education. Just like that, she quit her jobs and I was the sole breadwinner and often signed contracts and did not pay them, whereupon I received debt collection letters. \\n\\nI had to declare insolvency at some point, because we also had a joint loan running.\\n\\nI had also met a new woman half a year later and moved. Only my ex-wife really sabotaged this relationship and it didn\\'t last long. Also because I wanted to see my son regularly.\\n\\nI then decided to stay alone for 2 years, but lived near my ex-wife again because of my son. \\n\\nWhen I met my current partner, I decided to finally live my own life and not always be there for others. And moved a little further away. Got another wonderful daughter and everything looked like it was going uphill.\\n\\nAlso this time my ex-wife has tried to make our life hell, which led to the fact that I have quarreled with my partner very often and now also have no contact with my son for a year. \\n\\nMy job has also deteriorated more and more, because the company was bought up 3x and changed. The work climate has made me more and more broken and I had a second herniated disc. \\n\\nIn addition, I was then admitted to a day clinic, because I was also psychologically at the end. After a few months there, I was diagnosed with trauma therapy and was also diagnosed with bipolar narcism. \\n\\nI discontinued this therapy a year later because it didn\\'t help me at all.\\n\\nIn the meantime, however, I have screwed everything up ... I had to give up my job for health reasons, although I have a GDB of 30% and was equalized. I am also about to lose my partner, because there is more and more crisis between us. I really don\\'t have anyone in my life anymore. \\n\\nI have moved 13 times in my life in general. And have lost a lot of contacts and friends. I also lost some contacts because of my ex-wife. \\n\\nI generally only have contact with some friends I met online or old work colleagues. \\n\\nI also see my mother about 1-2 times a year but I don\\'t care if I see her at all or not. But she understandably wants contact with her grandchildren.\\n\\nI must also say to myself, I was a very difficult personality from a certain point and also my friends and partners had to learn to deal with it. I always had the urge to somehow talk nonsense and can hardly ever stay serious about anything, even when I write this text. You could subordinate it under \"joke addiction or Moria\". I also have a very low frustration threshold and go crazy quickly if I just drop something. Unfortunately I\\'m also very forgetful and often don\\'t know what I\\'m supposed to do several times a day. (I probably owe that to the alcohol). All in all, due to narcism I often have the impression of being emotionally dead. I cry in the rarest situation at all (even if sad videos still carry me away). I can hardly show empathy towards others. I also really don\\'t care about much and I notice it more and more. That I really don\\'t care about anything that happens. Apart from my children, I have never really had the feeling of being happy. In general, almost nothing good has ever happened to me. \\n\\nConclusion: So now I wonder does it even make sense for me to exist? \\n\\nI am insolvent I have a divorce behind me. My partner will leave me soon. I have no job anymore. No friends . And probably soon no more apartment (since I then the insolvent also no new apartment more find). \\n\\nEDIT: \\n\\nFirst of all, thank you all! \\n\\nYou have really touched my heart, even if it is hard for me to admit something like that. \\n\\nYou don\\'t have to worry about me doing anything to myself! \\n\\nI don\\'t want my children to have a horrible childhood like me! \\n\\nBesides, for your love! You are really great and I understood that there are things in life worth living for! \\nOf course, I will also seek professional help. \\nIt is not very easy to get appointments here but I will keep at it and not give up! \\nI know I can\\'t change my past but I can change my future!\\n\\nMy inbox has exploded with messages and I have already replied to some.

I don't recommend burdening other people with all your issues because that would just drive them away. People have enough shit in their own lives to deal with.

It leaves me with the impression that if I sever ties with everyone to the point where I am, in their eyes, irredeemable garbage, that maybe I'll finally be free from my death causing pain to others. At least that was my impression before I realized the hard way that it would only shift the pain from my death to my actions.

At least I tried to get help from my parents, friends, school, hotlines, reddit but nobody wants to help. The only person I had left was my bf but yesterday he just said he feels like all he is is a therapist to me. It really broke my heart into a million pieces. Because I dont have anybody else to talk to and he always said it was okay for me to vent to him. \\n\\nMy parents called me a freak and a weirdo, said that I need to snap out of this and get over myself, after they saw my stupid blog about my depression when I was 13 (idk why I made that - 13 yr old me was questionable) they got enraged. When they saw my self harm at 14 they got really mad. The tension in the house and the shame was unbearable, I couldnt look at them in the eyes and spent most of my time hiding in my room. Now I act like I\\'m fine and happy all the time, we talk about other stuff and joke and laugh together, and its massively improved our relationship. I\\'m grateful to have parents I now get along with. But it\\'s only because I hide my mental health. Lately things have gotten so bad, its getting hard for me to hide it from them. I\\'m forgetting to do things they told me to, I\\'m losing things they lent to me, they\\'re getting pissed off when I didnt mean to. I\\'m not doing this on purpose. Got mad because I didnt phone my grandma to thank her for some money. Of course it came across as rude and I felt so guilty. My whole family probably thinks I dont care about them. I feel like shit but they dont want to know the truth.\\n\\nMy friends - they all have it bad. Bad home lives, mental health problems, every single one of them, and I\\'m always trying to help them. But when I tried to open up they treated it like a competion and didnt even ask what was up with me just said they had it worse. I havent spoken to them in weeks because I\\'m so depressed and nobody even checks up on me to see how I am. It\\'s hard to pretend im happy and smiling and laughing so I dont talk to them. I\\'m not okay but they\\'re not in the right place to help me they need help themselves.\\n\\nIt\\'s getting really hard to socialise. I talk to my boyfriend everyday and it\\'s just so so so hard to talk and do normal things with him, I try to cover up how bad I\\'m hurting but sometimes I crack, he said it was okay for me to vent anytime but it looks like I did it too much and he says he feels like a therapy buddy. I feel so fucking shit that I cant even get my shit together.\\n\\nSchool is so difficult. I log onto my live lessons and sit there and listen to my tutor saying \"mental health matters guys!\" When their school counsellor wont even bother to show up. Time and time again the school counsellor has cancelled on me LAST MINUTE or during class when we cant use our phones, or just simply not been there. My mental health doesn\\'t fucking matter to the school does it. They say \"its really important we look after our wellbeing\" so they suggest going out for a walk, breathing, taking breaths and \"talking to someone\", well we already know that\\'s not fucking possible. But the other tips are just really basic level things, they don\\'t bother to invest deeper into mental health and help people with genuine problems because they might not have superhero parents that can get them to the doctors or therapists, they only tell us how to \"look after our wellbeing\" when I\\'m doing all those things and it\\'s gone beyond that. I\\'m REALLY doing badly. And they dont care. They just expect you to get on with it. So I get told off for not participating in my live lessons. Well I\\'m sorry that I tried to reach out for help because you said mental health matters and yet I got nothing so you now you expect me to act okay and surprise surprise I cant fucking do it. I cant switch off my mental health for you, school. There is no place in school for people like me when they expect you to be motivated, high achieving, focused, participating, just always okay, and I cant do it!!! And I know this will transfer into the real world, the working world, they always expect you to be okay. And it\\'s not like I want to walk around looking all miserable, but it\\'s just getting so hard to keep that happy mask on all the time.\\n\\nI have a university interview coming up soon. I dont know if I can do it. I\\'m so broken and suicidal that I dont think I can act all enthusiastic and persuade them I\\'d be a great, passionate, hardworking student when I can barely do my schoolwork and struggle to even get out of bed, dress myself and eat.\\n\\nTheres so many signs I\\'m struggling. And nobody cares. If you\\'re lucky, they will say they do, they spit out the cliches, give you the useless suicide hotline number and move on with their lives.

Somehow I was the popular girl in class (I\\'m doing masters), and I was always surrounded by a huge group of \"friends\". All that changed this quarantine. I began to see how much I was never really needed in these people\\'s lives. It first hit me on my birthday - the people I thought were close to me, didn\\'t even bother doing a video call for me, or even send anything on my birthday. This was in stark contrast to another girl\\'s birthday in the group - they all had a video call (I was told to join), made a loving video for her (compilation of clips and pictures), and had a small virtual party for her.\\n\\nThis really hurt me, and over the next few months, I saw them drifting more and more away. Now, this has been the pattern for \"friends\" throughout my life - my work friends, and even school friends. These all are people I was immensely close to at one point. But now I\\'m not in touch with anyone. Whenever I do try to strike up conversations, they just humor me for a few minutes before ending the conversation. Or other times, they are already close with each other as a group and I feel like an outsider.\\n\\nAnother thing - whenever I thought I was best friends with someone, they instantly replaced me with someone bubblier, more extroverted, or more \"fun\" within months. This has happened to me since my school days. It hurt me a lot but I didn\\'t speak about it for fear of looking desperate or being ridiculed. So I bottle it all in. An incident that will be always etched in my mind is something that happened on my 22nd birthday - my boyfriend at the time had broken up with me, and I was all alone. There was a girl who I naively thought was my best friend up until that time. I ended up buying and taking a cake to her place in the hopes that we would celebrate my bday, or maybe she had something planned for me (she did it for all her other friends). When I got there, she looked surprised and very very much like she pitied me.

I feel like the odd person always, I feel disgusted with myself. Like I can\\'t even look at myself without all these negative thoughts flooding in. I\\'m lonely, 0 social life. I\\'ve been dealing with this for 5 years, I cant take it anymore. Im burned out. I have no motivation to keep going. And before you say \"Your family will be sad\" I do not care. I am done. Maybe when I die I can finally seek the revenge I deserve. I just want to die, I\\'m still surprised that I lived to my 14th birthday. My mom says to \"Pray that I get better\" Or that I\\'m not reading enough of the bible. I\\'m SICK of it. She says a demon has probably took over me because I feel the way I feel. She knows that I\\'m deppressed and won\\'t let me see a therapist. I hope that she can stop my brother from having the same fate as me. I\\'m sorry.',\n",
              "       \"I was quite shocked at their reactions. I sorta expected a very stigmatized reaction for some reason. The first professor blew up on me in immediate concern for my well-being. He too had actually been through similar circumstances when he was younger. And the second professor, he had a close friend who was suicidal and very depressed as well. He was very calm throughout the whole conversation actually. That was a really fucking cool thing to have a legit chat about mental health with college professors. \\n\\nEdit: I really can't express enough how reassuring all of your supportive comments are. I would like everyone to know that I actually just recently started therapy for the first time this semester. And it is doing wonders. Hopefully I get the courage to schedule with the on campus psychiatrist soon to see if medication can help. Also, thank you all for reminding me that people do care about others. Thank you greatly.\",\n",
